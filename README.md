Title: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Approaches on the Prediction of the Electronic Properties of Perovskite: A Case Study of the ABX3 and A2BB’X6

# Abstract
The high cost of high-throughput screening and ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations has resorted in material scientists and engineers developing new material discovery methods via Machine Learning (ML) principles. This results in designing and applying appropriate ML models in predicting target-driven properties on well-prepared datasets and subsequently evaluating the standard errors within acceptance range with the perovskite crystal structure under the limelight. In this research, two distinctive perovskite crystal configurations: ABX3 and A2BB'X6 compounds are considerably understudied using 12 ML techniques. A comparative investigation of prediction performance on all ML models is conducted over two target electronic properties: the formation energy and energy bandgap. To arrive at our preliminary results, two complementary steps were followed. First, the crystal structures used as samples were represented by well developed, dimensionally identical and generalized descriptors based on their basic site-element properties, stability properties, and crystallographic details. Secondly, hyper-parameters are strategically identified via grid search technique for all ML models in order to optimize the prediction exercise. On ranking performance accuracy of all models, three standard metrics were used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-square (R2) values. Our results show that among all ML models applied in study, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model is the top performer whereas the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model performed least best. More so, SVR significantly dominated over other models in predicting both target electronic properties. For the formation energy, reported error metrics on the combined ABX3 and A2BB’X6 samples were calculated to be: 0.055 eV MAE, 0.096 eV RMSE and 99 % R2-test while on the energy bandgap, accuracy metrics were evaluated at: 0.493 eV MAE, 0.717 eV RMSE, and 81.58% R2-test set. Furthermore feature importance is engineered in order to streamline the initial input descriptors to include 24 of the most important attributes and consequently eliminate redundancy. This research provides a compendium of standardized error evaluation on ABX3 and A2BB’X6 perovskites using well established ML models on target-driven electronic properties.
